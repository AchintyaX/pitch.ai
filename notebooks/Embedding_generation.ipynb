And Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government\\'s willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan\\'s speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. \"I think the chairman\\'s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he\\'s taken for some time,\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. \"He\\'s taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"  Worries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China\\'s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency\\'s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing\\'s policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \"time is ripe\" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve\\'s decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US\\'s yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars. ',\n",

But analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the US economy were still significant. They also pointed out that positive comments apart, President George W Bush\\'s administration had done little to stop the dollar\\'s slide. A weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. The dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100GMT, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 November. Against the Japanese yen, it was trading at 105.28 yen, after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.  Policy makers in Europe have called the dollar\\'s slide \"brutal\" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. However, it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro\\'s rise at a monthly meeting of Eurozone ministers late on Monday. Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as a way the huge US current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. Mr Snow who is currently in Dublin at the start of a four-nation EU visit, has applauded Ireland\\'s introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth. \"The eurozone is growing below its potential. When a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners,\" he said. Mr Snow\\'s comments may have helped shore up the dollar on Monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement.  \"Our basic policy, of course, is to let open, competitive markets set the values,\" he explained. \"Markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals.\" US officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the US is not the main global growth engine. Economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the US economy are looking far from rosy. Domestic consumer demand is cooling, and heavy spending by President Bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (Â£230bn). The current account deficit, meanwhile, hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. For many analysts, a weaker dollar is here to stay. \"No end is in sight,\" said Carsten Fritsch, a strategist at Commerzbank . \"It is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30.\" Some analysts maintain the US is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in Europe, thus boosting its economy.

       "  'content': ' The dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the US economy.  The greenback hit $1.3516 in thin New York trade, before rallying to $1.3509. The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about $1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the US trade and budget deficits. Meanwhile, France\\'s finance minister has said the world faced \"economic catastrophe\" unless the US worked with Europe and Asia on currency controls. Herve Gaymard said he would seek action on the issue at the next meeting of G7 countries in February. Ministers from European and Asian governments have recently called on the US to strengthen the dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies. \"It\\'s absolutely essential that at the meeting of the G7 our American friends understand that we need coordinated management at the world level,\" said Mr Gaymard.  Thursday\\'s new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the US had fallen 12% in November - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity.  Commerce Department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the US economy - grew just 0.2% last month. The figure was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8% rise in October. The official US policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters.  The US government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from \"abnormal and dangerous heights\" set in 2002. The US says it will let market forces determine the dollar\\'s strength rather than intervene directly. Statements from President Bush in recent weeks highlighting his aim to cut the twin US deficits have prompted slight upturns in the currency. But while some observers said the quiet trade on Thursday had exacerbated small moves in the market, most agree the underlying trend remains downwards. The dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further, albeit less dramatic weakening, in 2005. \"I can see it finishing the year around $1.35 and we can see that it\\'s going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in 2005, finishing the year around $1.40,\" said Adrian Hughes, currency strategist with HSBC in London.

       "  'content': ' The gap between US exports and imports has widened to more than $60bn (Â£31.7bn), an all-time record.  Figures from the Commerce Department for November showed exports down 2.3% to $95.6bn, while imports grew 1.3% to $155.8bn on rising consumer demand. Part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports. But the numbers suggested the sliding dollar - which makes exports less expensive - has had little impact, and could indicate slowing economic growth.  The trade deficit - far bigger than the $54bn widely expected on Wall Street - prompted a rapid response from the currency markets.  By 1650 GMT, the dollar was trading against the euro at $1.3280, almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement. Against the pound, the dollar was down about 0.7% at $1,8923. \"The dollar\\'s fall has been sudden, violent and appropriate given this number,\" said Brian Taylor of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. \"Recent exchange rate movements certainly haven\\'t had any impact yet.\" Treasury Secretary John Snow put a brave face on the news, saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion. \"The economy is growing at such a fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income... some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners.\"  Although the White House officially still backs the US\\'s traditional \"strong dollar\" policy, it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued. The dollar has fallen by 50% against the euro - as well as by 30% against the yen - in the past three years. The main catalyst, most economists accept, is the large budget deficit on the one hand, and the current account deficit - the difference between the flow of money in and out of the US - on the other. The trade deficit is a large part of the latter. In November, the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals, as well as of cars, consumer goods and food. One small bright spot for US policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with China, often blamed for job losses and other economic woes. Although China\\'s overall trade surplus is expanding, according to Chinese government figures, the Commerce Department revealed the US\\'s deficit with China was $19.6bn in November, down from $19.7bn the month before. But the deficit with Japan was at its worst in more than four years. ',\n",

US officials were talking up the dollar, they said, but failing to take action to back up their words. Meeting in Brussels, finance ministers of the 12 eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports. The dollar is within touching distance of an all-time low reached earlier in November. At 0619 GMT on Tuesday, the dollar was up slightly at just above $1.29 to the euro, and buying 105.6 yen in Tokyo. It rallied briefly on Monday amid signs that oil prices are easing.  But analysts said the respite was likely to be only temporary. The European ministers\\' comments, said Junya Tanase of JPMorgan Chase bank in Tokyo, were \"generally too weak to produce a market reaction\".  Still, by the standards of diplomacy the European ministers were forthright. Nicolas Sarkozy of France said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit Europe\\'s economies by eating into their exports. \"We are concerned about these developments, which are destabilising, and which are linked to the accumulation of deficits by our American friends,\" he said. The comments come a day after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was \"in America\\'s interest\".  But that was not enough for Mr Sarkozy.  \"If the Americans were to change their policy, it\\'s up to them to say so,\" he said. And the European Union\\'s monetary affairs commissioner, made it clear that action was necessary. \"I fully welcome the words of Mr Snow,\" said Joaquin Almunia, \"but we will need to see decisions adopted in that direction. \"If the imbalances in the US economy are not adjusted in the future, the decision in the market will be as in the past weeks.\" Economists point out that whatever Europe says, in the short term a weaker dollar is a boon to President George W Bush\\'s administration. Not only does it boost US exports, but it also makes the budget deficit easier to fund. On the other hand, slower European exports would mean slower EU growth - potentially reducing the demand for US goods. ',\n",

Liquidity - a measure of the number of parties willing to trade in the market - was about half that of a normal working day, traders said. ',\n",

Investors are betting that the European Central Bank will not weaken the euro, while the US is thought to favour a declining dollar to fund its ballooning trade deficit. Analysts predict the dollar is likely to fall even further.',\n",

       "  'content': ' The US trade deficit widened by more than expected in October, hitting record levels after higher oil prices raised import costs, figures have shown  The trade shortfall was $55.5bn (Â£29bn), up 9% from September, the Commerce Department said. That pushed the 10 month deficit to $500.5bn. Imports rose by 3.4%, while exports increased by only 0.6%. A weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports, though this should help drive export demand in coming months. \"Things are getting worse, but that\\'s to be expected,\" said David Wyss of Standard & Poor\\'s in New York. \"The first thing is that when the dollar goes down, it increases the price of imports. \"We are seeing improved export orders. Things seem to be going in the right direction.\"  Despite this optimism, significant concerns remain as to how the US will fund its trade and budget deficits should they continue to widen. Another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with China, which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports. The US imported almost $20bn worth of goods from China during October, exporting a little under $3bn. \"It seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains,\" said Anthony Crescenzi, a bond strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. The trade deficit and the shortfall with China \"are big issues going forward\". The Commerce Department figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a fifth time this year. Borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25% at a Fed meeting later on Tuesday. ',\n",
